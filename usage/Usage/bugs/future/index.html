    <h2>Future Development Proposals</h2>This is a list of existing
    problems, and wants in ImageMagick. It is also a sort of
    un-offical guide for things I may try to implement in IM.
    Anything listed here is open for review, comment or suggestion,
    but should be taken with a grain of salt as they may never
    actually be implemented. though the more comments people make
    on the <a href=
    "http://legacy.imagemagick.org/Usage/forum_link.cgi?f=1">ImageMagick
    Discussion Forum</a> and in emails to me, the more likely it
    will get implemented!

    <h3>MVG expansion to allow full use of SVG gradients</h3>SVG
    gradients which are overlaid as a 'fill tile', can be defined
    using multiple colors (not just two), linearly from one point
    to another (any angle), radially, or using path shapes. The how
    range is defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/">SVG
    -- Scalable Vector Graphics</a> manual. Currently IM only
    supports vertical linear gadients across the whole canvas of
    the image. This lack is becoming important as just about every
    SVG image I have looked at relies of gradients of various forms
    for shading images. Without it the SVG image conversion are
    basically yuck!. An expandsion of the "<code>gradient:</code>"
    syntax to provide extra options would also be good. For example
    (posibility only)
    <pre>
  gradient:'red=.1-green=.3-blue=.9, 1,1, 50,90'
</pre>These are suggestions for the future development for IM. They
are currently not being developed but have been requested my myself
and other users on the IM mail lists and web forum. Some of these
may never be developed, others may not be provided until a new
major version number release of IM. Some may appear next week! If
you feel you can help, you can attempt to program these into IM and
send the patches to Crisy. I am sure he wold welcome them.

    <h3>Scripted form of Convert Command</h3><b>This is now being
    implemented in IMv7</b><br>
    For details see <a href=
    "../IMv7_Scripting.txt">IMv7_Scripting.txt</a>. What is really
    needed is for the command line API to be re-written in such as
    way as to allow...
    <ul>
      <li>argument processing, using pure argument order (IMv6
      mixes this up a bit)</li>
      <li>the ability to read all arguments from a file (convert
      scripts!). This could allow you to call IM, such as from PHP,
      without needing to do so though a shell wrapper. That is
      start IM as a piped open, and feed the commands to it.</li>
      <li>argument strings from a file ("@filename") or pipeline
      ("@-")</li>
      <li>insertion of numbers (with/without math processing) of
      values extracted from images already in memory</li>
      <li>Proper handling of global settings, verses image
      attribute settings.<br>
      Say snapshot and restore global settings.<br>
      Keep global and image attributes separate at API call
      level.<br>
      <br></li>
      <li>Posible loop mechisims. Such as Loop over images in list,
      or reperat X times, numbers accessable as a percent
      escape.</li>
      <li>if-then-else constructs for command line/script
      handling.</li>
      <li>generation of definable and callable functions</li>
      <li>conversion of command line options/script to compilable C
      program</li>
    </ul>This re-write may require some re-coding of mogrify which
    current does some very weird argument handling to separate the
    list of images to process, from the operations and settings
    needed to process them. For example some settings need to be
    pre-set before reading the first image! This new command line
    API could in fact be done as a separate command to convert, but
    will need someone to get the ball rolling and keep it moving.
    One previous attempt that failed (probably was done before IM
    was ready for it) was "conjure". The new version would have to
    be BOTH command line and script capable, and do what convert
    does to properly replace convert.

    <h3>Auto-levels, Stretching, Auto-Gamma, De-normalizing
    problem</h3>A IM Forum <a href=
    "http://redux.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?p=24216">
    Discussion</a> has resulted in a request for a
    "<code>-histogram-stretch</code>" operator which normalizes the
    image so that the given percentage of the brightest and darkest
    pixels are pegged to black and white. That is a single odd
    white or black pixel will not majorly effect the overall
    result. A "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#linear-stretch">-linear-stretch</a></code>"
    operator was also added recently.<br>
    Another IM mail list discussion between <i>Jason Lamey</i> and
    <i>Ed Halley</i>, talked about a posible gamma level auto
    adjusting operator. Fit a gaussian peak to a histogram. This
    will give you a peak position, and a width for the peak (two
    half-widths, actually). Then choose a gamma value that will
    realign the distribution to be more centered and appropriately
    wide. Redistributing the Histogram based on 'equalizing' the
    colors to fit a gaussian peak was also suggested by a image
    expert <i>Fred Weinhaus</i>. The overall brightness and
    contrast of an image can then be controled by two simple
    arameters (mean and std).
    <pre> A simpler and linear transformation can be effective if one computes the
linear transformation from a formula that uses desired mean and standard
deviations along with the image's actual mean and standard deviation. That was
why I was asking if you have a function that can extract the images mean and
standard deviation (as well as the min and max values). Something like
"-identify or info:" but more of an image statistics function that would report
these values per channel.  This could be very useful.  </pre>I have
yet to find a real-world use for "<code><a href=
"../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#equalize">-equalize</a></code>"<br>

    The current "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#contrast-stretch">-contrast-stretch</a></code>"
    operator normalizes images using the peak color values in the
    image, then moving those points inward by the percentages
    given. This provides a more controled normalize. <b>Current
    Recommended Solution</b>...
    <pre>
Linear 'stretching' methods should be able to...

For example woring with 8bit values and image with min = 100  and max =
200 (make it easy) and a autolevel parameter of say 20 (units).

  1/  find the max and min values than move inward by 'percentage'
      so min+20  max-20   =&gt;  level 120,180
      (black/white point arguments are 'color values')

  2/  cut off 20 pixel values from each end of the histogram
      (black/white point arguments are 'pixels')

  3/  select the value of the first bin from each end where the number
      of values in the exceeds 20  (the height of the bin)
      (black/white point arguments are 'pixels per bin')

Also note that histograms have multiple types.
   separate color channels,  grayscale,  all values
   luminance (HSL colorspace)

Once the points have been determined (per channel or combined channels)
then the 'level' routines can be used to do the 'stretch' (as per -level).

Implementation should separate the generation of histogram data that can then
be used by various histogram modification methods. Including the posibility of
the data of one image being used for a completely different image!

Data output should correctly handle 8-bit histogram output (existing bug).

The data can also be used to generate, histogram gradients, cumultive histogram
gradients. Also we should be able to do gradient graphing (profile
generation), rather than using external image generating applications.

The data will also be used for equalize, and equalize-gaussian, histogram
re-distribution, as well as histogram thresholding methods, and histogram
segmentation.

    <h3>Better handling of histograms, as LUT gradient images</h3>
    <pre>
Hmmmmm....   I wonder if we can change the histogram: usage.

That is  histogram: currently outputs a simple normalized  LUT  histogram
(one row)  and also we add   cumulative:  to output a normalize cumulative
histogram.

BUT we also add    graph:   which graphs a LUT image!

Now that would be great!  It can even follow the techniques that you
developed in your "profile" script.  Or the displacement graphing
technique I developed.



Better still lets take all this OUT of the output and make them
operations.

   -histogram  -cumulative  -graph

Now this would be great!!!  Of course they can still contain a
comment listing the actual value counts.

We would need to be careful of both operations when a IM Q8 is used
or the upper values could be clipped when the data is saved back into
a image.   8bits means a maximum count of 255!  That is not very many
pixels!  A solid color 16x16 image could exceed that!

As such some expert otpions to control...
  * number of bins
  * height of the histogram (clipping to prevent high peaks)
    Actual value or based on image_size/number_of_bins
  * scaling of the histogram (especially for Q8 versions)
     + automatic  so maximum value maps to quantum range
     + fixed  N pixels to 1 value in histogram  (1:1 default)

A cumulative function would probbaly need to be normalised to work.
After all a 256x256 pixel count would fill a 16 bit value,
unless HDRI is actually used.

    <h3>Divide an image into horizontal rows (or columns) of
    pixels</h3>Given an image, divide the image into rows (or
    columns) basied on rows of pixels which are simular to each
    other (according to the fuzz factor). One implementation would
    be to divide image into blank,non-blank... alturnating rows
    extracted from the image. An argument can used to place
    constraints on the minimum size for the separate blank and
    non-blank areas. A missed image at the start can denote if the
    first part was non-blank, something that is commonly just
    junked. The offset positions can be kept or junked as per crop.
    Two operators may be needed, -divide-vert and
    -divide-horiz.<br>
    EG: divide-horizontally +{bw}+{nbw} Complementary operators
    such as -layers 'remove-blank' and -layers 'remove-null' may be
    needed to allow user to also delete 'blank' images if these are
    unwanted. <b>ADDUMDUM</b> I wrote a script <a href=

    basically what I am suggesting gets built into IM. Another
    similar script is <a href=

    <h3>Consolidation of Specialized Blur Options</h3>Currently we

    and "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#motion-blur">-motion-blur</a></code>"

    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#radial-blur">-radial-blur</a></code>"
    is miss-named, as it is really a rotational blur. A radial blur
    would blur out from the center point of the image or region,
    not in a circle around that point.Secondally these speciallised
    blurs are only the start of a whole set of blur type operations
    that should be made available. And implementing as a single
    option per blur type woudl produce far too many options. It
    needs to be consolidated before new types of blurs are
    introduced. I can see 7 types of special blurs...

      others in the future.</li>
      <li>The <i>radius</i> and <i>sigma</i> is as normal though
      sigma represents an angle in degress rather than pixels in a
      'rotational' blurs.</li>
      <li><i>dir</i> is either 0 or 3 for blurs in BOTH directions
      (default = 0)<br>
      1 for blur only in one positive direction<br>
      2 for blur in the other negative direction</li>
      <li><i>angle</i> is the angle for a linear blur (defaults =
      0)</li>
    </ul>I do not want to separate these into separate settings as
    they are linked too closely to the specific operation being

    <a name="layout" id="layout"></a>
    <h3>Image layout methods</h3>Addition of "layout" methods to
    "convert". For example a 'layout' method to generate a montage
    'grid'. A fixed sized grid of cells with optional spacing
    between cells. Spacing may be negative to allow overlapping
    images, but will NOT 'clip' edge images (due to negative
    spacing) as "montage" currently does. Note that spacing is not
    just a 'border' added to each image, as spacing on ends is the
    same as in the middle, except in the negative case.
    Implementation can ignore any existing 'virtual canvas'
    setting, though could use use virtual canvas layering
    techniques to do image layout more efficientally. Another
    posible layout method is 'lines', which appends images
    horizontally (with given spacings), with the appropriate
    vertical "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#gravity">-gravity</a></code>"
    alignment, until "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#size">-size</a></code>"
    width, is reached. The line is then horizontally -gravity
    justified, and padded to the "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#size">-size</a></code>"
    width. When the height of all the lines exceeds a optionally
    given "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#size">-size</a></code>"
    height, a new 'page' image is started, but pages are not
    padded, which will allow vertical justification using
    "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#extent">-extent</a></code>"
    using a different gravity setting. Similarly for a 'columns'
    layout method but vertically, down the 'page' images, being
    generated. The "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#append">+/-append</a></code>"
    operator could be classed as a special type of layout method.
    One in which "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#size">-size</a></code>"
    is not used. Other posible layout methods could include 'best
    fit into page' using various 2D 'napsack packing' algorithms,
    though that may mix up the order of the images so as to produce
    the smallest number of 'pages'. See topic <a href=
    "http://legacy.imagemagick.org/Usage/forum_link.cgi?f=1&amp;t=21354">
    Re: Informal but coherent montage</a> for a 'randomized layout'
    idea. All methods however should record and keep track of the
    location each image ended up, for the purpose of 'HTML' image
    map generation, though it may be implemented as part of the
    image 'layering' rather than the specific layout method.
    Something that "montage" currently does but which goes wrong in
    its 'concatenate' mode. The above does NOT need to deal with
    frames, borders, captions, labels as these should be taken care
    of by pre-layout operations.
    <pre>
How a 'general layout' operator (or command, like "montage") should work.

1. Prepare images (rotations, framing, lables, and other 'fluff')
   This is generally external to the 'layout' method.

2. initial placement of images ( randomly cover background completely,
   form rows, columns, arcs, spirals, etc)
   Limits of placement (unlimited, or width, height limits, shaped area)?

3. optional adjustment of placements (minimise overlap, remove excess images
   such as those that go off the edge, or completely covered by other images)

4. re-order the image layering (input order, top/bottom/left/right placement
   order, center uppermost, edge uppermost, randomize)

5. output results....
     * flatten/mosaic/merge (generating the display image)
       (shadow handling may be added here)
     * generate imagemaps (for color index mapping)
     * generate imagemap table (color index, rectangular positions, to image
       name or link)
</pre>Note that all but the final step is really about generating a
image placement list, and may only involve the images as part of
that processing.

    <h3>Output size control for Montage</h3>Often it is imposible
    for a user to know how big a "<code>montage</code>" will be,
    and it has, many times, been suggested that some sort of output
    size control added. That is specify a final size and geometry
    size, and let montage work out the tiling, (and perhaps
    geometry spacing) to produce however many pages are nessary. Of
    course if the width of the individual tiles (as determined by
    -geometry is more that the final output size, then all bets are
    off, and a warning probably should be issued. Or, specify the
    final size and number of tiles, then let montage work out the
    geometry needed. What algorithm should be used for figuring out
    tile size verses tile spacing is another matter, particularly
    when labels and framing also needs to taken into account. It
    may be that in both cases some extra boarder space will be
    required to 'pad out' the image to the exact image size
    requested, as a variable geometry or tile setting may not
    generate an exact fit. At the moment there is no defined method
    of setting a final output image size. Also what should
    "<code>montage</code>" do if all three (size, tile, geometry)
    is given.
    <hr width="20" align="left">
    One suggestion is to allow the use of a '!' flag to
    "<code><a href=
    "../../../../html/www/command-line-options.html#tile">-tile</a></code>"
    as meaning a 'fit to this size if posible' setting. Of course
    the -tile setting (and extra boarder space) would then be the
    variable part of the montage generator. EG: "<code>-tile
    800x600\!</code>" would mean that montage will try to adjust
    the tile counts to form pages that fit into a final image of
    this size. OR: "<code>-tile 800x\!</code>" will only adjust the
    number of columns to fit into 800 pixels, in a single page of
    appropriate length. Some extra spacing may have to be added to
    the edges to handle any remaining space that can't be assorbed
    by the tile geometry size or spacing. <b>NOTE:</b> This option
    is probably better implemented using core routines to replace
    montage completely. "Convert script?"

</pre>Note that 'Baseline' has no meaning for image justification.
But if specifically given for an images it should probably be equal
to either 'Bottom', 'Middle' or prehaps to align with text better,
1/3 from the Bottom.
    <pre>----
Additional thoughts.

Really for good positioning (composition) of anything (images or text) there
are lots of factors, which could be important to its final location.

  gravity (positioning on background image, with X,Y coord)
  placement  (how the 'rectangle' should be placed relative to that
               position, could also have a X,Y coord)
  scale/rotate
  justification  (how text is arranged within its 'box')

That last is actually text to image creation
The first we have already (but doing 'placement' as well)

All but justification are essentually SRT distort (no gravity).
But gravity can be calculated (relative to destination image)

    <h3>Limit FX to smaller areas of an image</h3>Having FX limit
    its effect to a specific region of an image. This is much like
    using channels to limit what values FX generate but limiting
    its use to smaller areas of image. Unlike regions however the
    i,j values will remain their correct values. Proposed Solution:
    using a "fx:limit" set/define...

    <a name="colorspace" id="colorspace"></a>
    <h3>Colorspace handling problems <font size="-1">(as I have
    come to know them)...</font></h3>A "#xxxxx" color is
    non-specific to the colorspace and as such can be applied ASIS
    to any colorspace. That is the value has a undefined
    colorspace, though an functional extension may allow you to
    define a colorspace for that color. There is no way of
    specifying a named color with some transparency level. EG: you
    can not specify a 50% transparent DodgerBlue color! Named
    colors is actually defined as an SRGB color (it isn't actually
    an RGB!) and needs to be converted to the colorspace in which
    the color is being applied. This is closely related to the
    problem reported by the user! That is when the color gets
    recorded for future use, the colorspace of that color should
    also be recorded so the color can be converted appropriatally
    when applied to, or compared against, some specific image. That
    is colors must be saved, not only with the 'values' but also
    the 'colorspace' of those values (unless undefined) This is
    also related to the fact that IM currently (IMv6 that is)
    stores image by default as RGB colorspace when it is in fact
    really SRGB colorspace. Most image formats should actually
    read/save images by default to SRGB, unless specifically
    declared otherwise. GIF images especially should only save and
    load as SRGB! While NetPBM/PbmPlus images are sometimes SRGB
    (real images) and sometimes RGB (mathematical images and
    gradients). Continuing this problem... is that -colorspace SRGB
    of an image (currently marked as RGB) actually converts from
    SRGB to linear RGB for processing (marked as SRGB internally).
    EG: the colorspace definations of RGB and SRGB in IMv6 is
    reversed! This should not be changed in IMv6, as it it too
    throughly embedded, but it should only be fixed in IMv7. The
    problem with this is that 'draw' functions is designed to do
    its anti-aliasing of lines and circles in linear RGB space. At
    least that is what my tests are showing! However images which
    are loaded are using SRGB colorspace. If you (correctly)
    convert images to linear RGB (using -colorspace SRGB) before
    drawing on them, then convert back before saving the draw
    anti-aliasing works perfectly, producing nice smooth edge
    results. See <a href=
    "https://legacy.imagemagick.org/Usage/draw/#colorspace">Drawing
    with Gamma and Colorspace Correction</a> for examples and
    details of this. However as the 'SRGB named colors' are applied
    by draw without regard to colorspace, a image converted to
    linear RGB colorspace and drawn to will have the applied named
    colors become out 'wrong', when the drawn image gets converted
    back to SRGB (using -colorspace RGB) for saving! In IMv6 direct
    drawing with named colors works, but only because draw is
    drawing directly to a SRGB colorspace image, and thus getting
    incorrect anit-aliased results. Drawing correctly in linear RGB
    gets the anti-alising right but the colors wrong. A loose-loose
    situation at present. Basically all these colorspace handling
    problems needs to be looked at and fixed in IMv7!

    <a name="fill" id="fill"></a>
    <h3>Fill enlarges drawn areas by 1/2 pixel</h3>Fill enlarges
    the fill area by 1/2 pixel. This is done to allow drawing of
    lines to work (or by default you never see any line drawn) but
    really it is wrong. It becomes a problem only when no stroke is
    used, and you want to 'join' adjacent polygonal areas. For
    examples see <a href="../../draw/index.html#bounds">Draw Fill
    Bounds</a> One solution is to have 'stoke' default to 'fill'
    when unset, and fill not 'enlarge' drawn areas. that way if you
    specific set stroke to 'none' areas will not become 'enlarged'.
    The problem is that at this time the stoke color can not be
    'unset', or fall back to 'fill'.
