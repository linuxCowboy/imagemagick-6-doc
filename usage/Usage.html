              <h1 align="center">Examples of ImageMagick Usage<br>
              <font size="5">(Legacy Version 6)</font></h1>These
              web pages presents a set of examples using <a href=
              "../html/index.html">ImageMagick</a> ("IM," for short),
              version 6, from the command line. However, they often
              have direct analogs in the current release of
              ImageMagick, <a href=
              "https://imagemagick.org">version 7</a>. They also
              illustrate what can be done using the ImageMagick
              Application Programming Interface (API). As such,
              these pages should be the first stop for IM users
              after reading the terse <a href=
              "../html/www/command-line-options.html">Command Line
              (CLI) Option manuals</a>. Often, the same questions
              of "<i>How do I...</i>" gets asked, over and over
              again on the network. The examples in these web
              pages, I hope, will answer most of the common
              "how-to" questions that arise.

          <h2>ImageMagick Examples - Introductory Notes</h2>
          <h3>What is ImageMagick? A No-Holds-Barred
          Summary</h3><a href=
          "script/index.php.html">ImageMagick</a> is designed for
          batch processing of images. That is, it allows you to
          combine image processing operations in a script (shell,
          DOS, Perl, PHP, etc.) so the operations can be applied to
          many images, or as a sub-system of some other tool, such
          as a Web application, video processing tool, panorama
          generator, etc. <i>It is not a GUI image editor</i>.
          ImageMagick is, first of all, an image-to-image
          converter. That is what it was originally designed to do.
          That is, it will convert an image in just about any image
          format (tell us if it can't) to any other image format.
          But it is also a library of <i>image processing
          algorithms</i>. These can be access via the command line
          and shell/DOS scripts (which these example pages
          demonstrate), or via a large number of programming
          languages, such as C, C++, Perl, Ruby, PHP, etc. See:
          <a href="script/develop.php.html">ImageMagick APIs</a>.
          Speed was never a major feature of IM, which places more
          emphasis on the quality of the images it generates. That
          is not to say that it can't transform images in a
          reasonable amount of time. It's just not blindingly fast.
          Because of this, IM can be slow to perform certain
          processing operations, especially when attempting to
          compress images into image formats that have limited
          capabilities. ImageMagick concerns itself mainly with
          images in the form of a <i>rectangular array of
          pixels</i>, commonly called a "raster." It will handle
          "vector" image formats like Postscript or PDF, but at the
          cost of converting those images into a raster when
          loading them, and generating a vector image wrapper
          around the raster when saving it. As a result, vector
          images are often processed badly when using the default
          settings. However, specific options can be used to
          improve this situation. See: <a href=
          "Usage/formats/#vector">A
          word about vector image formats</a>.
          <h3>About These Examples of ImageMagick Usage</h3>These
          pages were developed from, and are a continuation of, my
          <a href=
          "https://antofthy.gitlab.io/info/graphics/imagemagick.txt">
          Collection of ImageMagick Hints and Tips</a> page I first
          started in 1993, and placed on the new fangled
          world-wide-web making its appearance around the same
          time. Information on many aspects of IM, and notes not
          included in these pages, are still present in that
          document. However, while the present pages were designed
          for you to look at, the hints and tips document was only
          for my own edification. So, it may be vague or chaotic in
          places. You are welcome to look at it, learn, and make
          comments on it. Other examples were grabbed or developed
          from answers to users' questions on he <a href=
          "Usage/forum_link.cgi?f=1">
          IM Forums</a>, or contributed to me as solutions to
          various problems. I look forward to suggestions and
          e-mail from other IM users. Such e-mail generally results
          in improvements and expansions to these example pages.
          <h3>Command Line Environments</h3>All examples are
          written for use on UNIX, and specifically GNU/Linux
          systems, using BASH scripting. As a consequence, some
          examples use shell 'for-do' loops. Most examples use a
          backslash '<code>\</code>' at the end of a line to
          continue that command on the next line. The longer
          commands are broken into separate lines to try to further
          highlight the steps being applied. However, you can still
          use these examples from <b>PC Windows batch scripts</b>,
          with some changes to the handling of certain characters.
          With some slight adaptation, the examples can also be run
          directly from '<code>system</code>' calls in <b>PHP
          scripts</b>. See <a href="Usage/windows.html">Windows
          Usage</a> and <a href=
          "Usage/api/index.html">APIs
          and Scripting</a> for more information on using the
          ImageMagick commands in these alternative environments.
          Contributions and test examples are welcome.
          <h3>PerlMagick, and Other APIs</h3>It should also be
          possible to adapt any of these examples to use the IM API
          from languages such as Perl, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, and so
          on. I recommend trying things out on the command line
          first, until you get them right, and then converting the
          operations to the specific API you are using. Although
          the situation has improved enormously with IM version 6,
          the command line really only deals with a single image
          sequence at any one time. However, APIs do not have this
          limitation, and allow you to manipulate multiple image
          sequences, separately or together, to perform more
          complex operations. This ability makes it simpler to
          implement these examples using the IM API, and removes
          the need to save images as temporary files, as many of
          the command line examples require. When using an API,
          only permanent and semi-permanent images need be saved to
          disk. Basically, let the example pages give you a start,
          to let you see what is possible with ImageMagick. Then,
          formulate what you want to do on the command line, before
          coding the operations in scripts and API code, where it
          is harder to make extensive changes. I also recommend
          that you comment your API code, <b>heavily</b>, adding
          the command line equivalents to what you are trying to
          do, if possible. That way, you can check and compare the
          results against those using the command line. This lets
          you debug problems that you may come across later,
          especially as improvements are made to image processing
          in the Core ImageMagick Library.
          <h3>Downloading Input Images and Results</h3>As much as
          possible, I try to use images built-into IM (such as
          "<code>logo:</code>" or "<code>rose:</code>") as input
          images for IM example commands, or to generate input
          images using IM commands. I also often re-use the output
          of previous commands in later examples. Because of this,
          you usually don't need to download any 'test' images in
          order to try out the examples yourself. However, such
          generated or built-in images are not always convenient.
          So, when I do use an external image, I tend to re-use
          that input image, or the results of previous examples,
          for later examples in that section. Sometimes the
          original source image will be displayed or for larger
          images a link to the source image is provided. More
          commonly only the final resulting image will be shown, as
          the input is well known or obvious. Almost all the IM
          example commands shown are executed in the same web
          directory in which they appear. That is, the command you
          see is the command that was actually used to generate the
          image. Because of this you can modify the page's URL to
          download or view the input image(s) used by an example.
          Extra copies of the external source images have also been
          placed in the "<a href=
          "Usage/images/index.html">images</a>"
          and "<a href=
          "Usage/img_photos/index.html">img_photos</a>"
          sub-directories. See also the example of a <a href=
          "Usage/img_photos/INDEX.html">
          Fancy Photo Index</a> of those images. If text output or
          image information is produced by an example, it is saved
          to a text file, and an image of it is generated for
          display on the Web page. Selecting the text output image
          will link you to a copy of the actual text output by the
          command. In all these examples, selecting the output
          image should let you download the image which was
          actually created by the example command. But be warned,
          not all browsers understand all image formats used.
          <h3>External Image Sources</h3>By the way, most of the
          source images used in these examples come from <a href=
          "https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/">Anthony's Icon
          Library</a>, particularly the <a href=
          "https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/desc/cl-bgnd/Icons.html">
          background tiles</a>, <a href=
          "https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/large/Icons.html">large
          clip-art</a>, and <a href=
          "https://antofthy.gitlab.io/icons/dragons/Icons.html">dragons</a>
          sections of the library. (I like dragons!). ASIDE: these
          pages may be offline as the web site slowly moves to a
          new server. This library actually predates the WWW. I
          created it in 1991, due to the lack of good, clean iconic
          images for use on the X Window System. The advent of the
          WWW has of course changed this, but my original library
          still exists and remains available as a source of images,
          even though it is not actively growing. Some specific
          images, and larger images, are contributed by the authors
          of specific examples. The authors of such examples are
          listed in the contributed section, or at the bottom of
          the page. If you are looking for a specific image, I
          recommend using <a href=
          "http://images.google.com/imghp">Google Image Search</a>
          (or similar) to find something appropriate. You can, of
          course, convert or resize such images using IM for your
          own purposes. However, you should be careful about
          copyright if you plan to use such images commercially.

          <h3>PNG Images on Web Pages</h3><a href=
          "Usage/images/test.png"><img src="Usage/images/test.png"
          width="150" height="100" align="right" vspace="0" hspace=
          "5" border="0" alt="[IM Output]"></a> In many examples, I
          use an image in PNG format, such as that shown to the
          right of this text. The PNG image format supports images
          with semi-transparent pixels, a feature few other image
          formats provide. It is also a very well-understood image
          format and, as such, is usable by most of today's image
          programs and Web browsers. Some Web browsers, however, do
          NOT handle transparent PNG images correctly (most notably
          Microsoft Internet Explorer v6). Because of this, I
          generally use the JPEG and GIF formats for images on the
          Web, and only use the PNG format when generating images
          with semi-transparent pixels, or when exact colors are
          needed for later examples. To allow IE v6 browsers to
          display PNG images, I use a special 'style sheet' using
          complex JavaScript. For information on this, see <a href=
          "http://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/anthony/wwwlab/pngtest/">PNG
          with transparency for IE</a>. Technically, this is only
          problem with IE, not ImageMagick.

                <h3>Displaying Images on Your Screen</h3>Display
                problems can also occur when displaying images
                on-screen. Because of this, I recommend using a
                command like the following to tile a
                '<code>checkerboard</code>' pattern underneath the
                image, to highlight any transparent or
                semi-transparent pixels in it.
                <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
                width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
                  <tr>
                    <td>
                      <pre><code do_not_execute="">
    composite  -compose Dst_Over -tile pattern:checkerboard image.png x:

                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
              </td>
              <td>
                <a href=
                "Usage/test_undertile.jpg">
                <img src=
                "Usage/test_undertile.jpg"
                width="150" height="100" align="middle" vspace="0"
                hspace="5" border="1" alt="[IM Output]"></a>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>The image displayed in the above example is a
          special PNG-format <a href=
          "Usage/images/test.png">test
          image</a>, which was generated using the shell script
          "<code><a href=
          "Usage/scripts/generate_test">generate_test</a></code>".
          Normally, the command would output the results to your
          display, not onto a Web page like this. If you look
          carefully, you can see the checkerboard pattern though
          the semi-transparent colors. However, the image, as a
          whole, is fully opaque. So, this technique should work on
          all displays, Web browsers, and image viewers. As of IM
          v6.0.2, the "<code>display</code>" program performs
          something like this automatically. However, it does not
          seem to handle images using color tables (i.e., GIF) in
          this way. Using the "<code>x:</code>" output image format
          (as above) causes an image to be displayed directly to
          the screen, without having to save it. See <a href=
          "Usage/files/#show">Show
          Output Display</a> for more information. <a name="font"
          id="font"></a>
          <h3>Font Usage</h3>The fonts I use in these examples are
          from a small collection of TrueType fonts I have found
          over the years, and saved for my own use. Some of these
          are under copyright, so I cannot publish them online. You
          are, however, welcome to substitute other fonts that you
          have available. The examples should work (perhaps with
          some changes to image size) with any appropriate font you
          have available on your system. Microsoft "Arial" font, or
          even "Times-BoldItalic", should work on most systems. To
          see what fonts are currently available to your version of
          IM, run the following command...
          <div align="center">
            <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
            width="80%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <pre><code do_not_execute="">
    convert -list type       # for IM older than v6.3.5-7
    convert -list font       # for newer versions
</code></pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>WARNING: If the font requested is not found,
          ImageMagick used to silently substitute a default font,
          typically Arial or Times. It still does this, but a
          warning is now given. So, test the font beforehand, to
          make sure that it is the one you want, and not the
          default font. On my Linux system, I use a special Perl
          script, "<code><a href=
          "Usage/scripts/imagick_type_gen"><b>imagick_type_gen</b></a></code>",
          to generate a file, "<code>type.xml</code>", saved in the
          "<code>.magick</code>" sub-directory of my home
          directory. ImageMagick uses that file, which contains a
          font list in XML format, to find fonts. The script
          "<code>locate</code>"s (run "<code>updatedb</code>"
          first, if you have just added new fonts), and describes
          all the fonts available on my system. With this setup, I
          only need to specify the name of the font I want to use,
          and not the full path to a specific font file. For
          example...
          <div align="center">

          <h3>Example Page Updates</h3>These example pages are in
          an on-going cycle of improvement. Generally, I find I
          stop adding to these pages for long periods of time, when
          my interests become focused on other things. Often these
          examples are re-built using the latest beta release of
          IM, allowing me to see changes and bugs that may appear
          in each version of IM, before it is generally released.
          However, the example images shown are what the given IM
          command produces on <b>my</b> system. If you get
          something different, your IM is probably a much older
          version (with old bugs), or is not correctly installed.
          Note that e-mailing me, or discussing some aspect of
          ImageMagick on the <a href=
          "Usage/forum_link.cgi?f=1">
          IM Users Forum</a> will generally result in new examples,
          or whole new sections, being added to these examples. The
          more discussion there is, the better the examples become.
          If you are doing anything interesting with IM, please
          share, and allow me to provide examples of your technique
          to the rest of the IM community. Some of the biggest
          advances in IM usage have come from users just like you.
          <h3>Special Thanks</h3>A special thank you goes to
          Cristy, who has tirelessly spent months, upgrading,
          bug-fixing, and putting up with my off-the-wall
          suggestions... especially with regards to my major
          suggestions for the command line processing, parenthesis,
          image sequence operators, and GIF animation processing.
          He has done a marvelous job making Version 6 the best and
          most advanced command line image processing program
          available. While most users will not show appreciation
          for that, I certainly do appreciate the effort he has put
          into IM. I also want to thank Gabe Schaffer, who has been
          most helpful in discussions involving the JPEG format and
          library, affine matrix operators, and <a href=
          "script/magick-vector-graphics.php.html">Magick Vector
          Graphics</a> in general. And to Glenn Randers-Pehrson,
          who looks after the PNG coder module and has a interest
          in Color Quantization and Dithering. He was the first to
          add 'halftone' dithering to IM, which I later revised and
          extended further, to added new dithers to the ordered
          dither configuration file. 
          <!-- who is the Ruby on Rails person?
I also like to thank Rick Mabry, of the RMagick (Ruby API) who developed the
polariod picture techniques, and is a source of ideas and additions to IM
Examples. </P>
-->
          And finally, I want to thank the huge number of people
          with problems, suggestions, and solutions, who generally
          lurk on the <a href=
          "Usage/forum_link.cgi?f=1">
          IM User Forum</a>. Many now have their names as
          contributors of ideas and suggestions throughout IM
          Examples. I also want to thank the people who regularly
          answer questions on the forums, such as '<a href=
          "Usage/forum_link.cgi?u=6256">Bonzo</a>',
          and his web site <a href=
          "http://www.rubblewebs.co.uk/imagemagick/imagemagick.php">
          RubbleWebs</a>, detailing use of IM commands from PHP
          scripts. Also '<a href=
          "Usage/forum_link.cgi?u=143">scri8e</a>'
          and his Web site, <a href=
          "http://www.scri8e.com/stars/">Moons Stars</a>, for
          glitter and star handling. Also a thank you goes to Pete
          '<a href=
          "Usage/forum_link.cgi?u=3499">el_supremo</a>'
          A special thanks goes to <a href=
          "http://www.fmwconcepts.com/fmw/fmw.html">Fred
          Weinhaus</a>, a researcher from the early days of image
          processing, who was a major help in the initial
          implementation of the <a href=
          "Usage/distorts.html#distort">General Image Distortion
          Operator</a>. You can see Fred's ImageMagick scripts on
          <a href="http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/">Fred's
          ImageMagick Site</a>, often as a proof of concept for
          future IM additions. Also to Nicolas Robidoux, an expert
          in digital image processing, for reworking the <a href=
          "Usage/distorts.html#area_resample">Elliptical Weighted
          Average Resampling</a>, which vastly improves the output
          of <a href="Usage/distorts.html#distort">General Image
          Distortion</a>. And finally to the many users of
          ImageMagick who, had allowed others to see the IM
          commands they use as part of some project, either on the
          forums, or on the web. You are all to be commended on
          your willingness and openness to share your findings.<br>

          Well enough "Yadda, yadda, yadda." &nbsp; Go look at some
          of the examples.
